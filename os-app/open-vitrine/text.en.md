_KOMVitrineDescription_

Kommit is an app to help you with memorization. Inspired by [Anki](KOM_VITRINE_ANKI_URL) and other spaced-repetition learning systems, it presents flashcards to you just before your brain is likely to forget, thereby strengthening memory while reducing study time.

Check out the features below or read the [guide](KOMVitrineTokenGuideURL) to learn more.

The code is open-source and available on [GitHub](KOM_SHARED_GITHUB_URL).

The project is freely accessible but if you are in a position to give, please [donate](KOM_SHARED_DONATE_URL) to support future development.
