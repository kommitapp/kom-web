_KOMVitrineDescription_

Kommit is an app to help you with memorization. Inspired by [Anki](KOM_VITRINE_ANKI_URL) and other spaced-repetition learning systems, it presents flashcards to you just before your brain is likely to forget, thereby strengthening memory while reducing study time.

Check out the features below or [try it](KOMVitrineTokenReviewURL).

The code is open-source and available on [GitHub](KOM_SHARED_GITHUB_URL).

The project is freely accessible but if you are in a position to give, please [donate](KOM_SHARED_DONATE_URL) to support future development.
